Hi, I'm Kolby Samson.

I'm a Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) major at the University of Washington-Bothell, set to graduate in June 2022.

I have a strong passion for Backend Software Development, DevOps/Infrastructure, Cloud Computing, and other emerging technology fields. I strive to attain a career in these fields that has a positive worldwide impact. I am experienced in Java, Golang, and Python development and have worked with DevOps/Infra tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and GitLab CI/CD. 

Please see my repositories page for a list of projects I am working on to improve my computer science and software engineering skills.

Thank you!
