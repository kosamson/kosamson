Hi, I'm Kolby Samson.

I'm a Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) major at the University of Washington-Bothell, set to graduate in 2022.

I have a passion for software engineering and information security and strive to attain experience in these fields prior to a full-time career. I am experienced in Java, C++, and Python development and am familiar with basic web development through HTML and CSS.

Please see my repositories page for a list of projects I am working on to improve my computer science and software engineering skills.

Thank you!
